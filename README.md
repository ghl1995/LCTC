# Linear Combinations of Template Conformations (LCTC): AnEfficient Method to Quantify Structural Distributions inHeterogeneous Cryo-EM Datasets

## 1.Introduction
Our scheme shown in the following Figure is composed of four steps: 1) The best viewing angle to distinguish conformational changes was identified. 2) Template 3D structures generated by Multi-body Refinement of RELION were projected onto a number of viewing angles in proximity to the best viewing angle to generate template 2D images. 3) Cryo-EM 2D images were assigned to template 2D images via a two-stage matching process, in which the first computation of the pairwise distance was based on auto-correlation functions of the contours of masked images. Then comparison was performed on the pairwise distance based on pixel-pixel matching. 4) The populations of template structures were obtained.

## 2.Requirements
python, linux system and xmipp

## 3.Dataset
Each dataset is consisted of template structures and experimental structures. We use two expmples to test our algorithm, one is 
simulated dataset: Taq RNAP, the other is real dataset: Eco RNAP. 
We provided simualted dataset: open.vol, close.vol, intermediate.vol(same as test data and templates) 
and real dataset:6P1K.vol(test data), H_EV2_red.vol, H_EV2_grey.vol, H_EV2_blue.vol(templates), templates are generated by multi-body refinement of Relion.

## 4.RUN
Preprocess: you can use command: 
`xmipp_xmipp_volume_from_pdb -i open.pdb -o open.vol`     transfer pdb file to vol file

`xmipp_image_convert -i open.vol -o open.mrc`            transfer vol file to mrc file

run our algorithm: `python TSTM.py --datatype='sim' --vol_size=128`, the output is '2nd_stage_brute_force_classification_result.dat' 

and `python ./two_stage_matching/analyze_population.py` to obatin population and analyze.
